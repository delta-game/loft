LOFT incorporates assets from the FontAwesome ("Free") project, 
which are in-turn subject to the terms of their licensing system. 
(https://fontawesome.com/v4/license/, as-of March 2023). 

LOFT uses these assets in accordance with the terms of the license. 
The complete set of FontAwesome assets used in this project can be 
found in the `resource/fontawesome` directory in this repository.

LOFT is not affiliated with the FontAwesome project or its creators, 
and any issues related to the FontAwesome assets should be directed 
to the appropriate parties. LOFT has made only minimal modifications 
to the FontAwesome assets (like changing the base color).

In addition to the FontAwesome assets, LOFT may use other third-party 
assets or libraries, which are subject to their own licensing terms and 
conditions. These assets and libraries will be clearly identified and 
their licensing terms and conditions will be provided in this LEGAL.txt 
file or in a separate file included with the project.
